## Introduction

Welcome to our **Decentralized Chatting Application** built on the Avalanche blockchain. This innovative application provides a secure and decentralized platform for users to communicate with each other, taking advantage of the powerful Avalanche blockchain and leveraging the Fuji test network for development and testing.

Our application ensures the utmost privacy and security by utilizing the Metamask wallet address as the login mechanism. This way, users can seamlessly access the platform using their Metamask wallet, adding an extra layer of security to their accounts.

## Features

- **Decentralized Chatting:** Communicate with your friends in a completely decentralized environment, ensuring data integrity and privacy.
- **Avalanche Blockchain:** Our application harnesses the power of the Avalanche blockchain, providing scalability and low transaction fees.
- **Fuji Test Network:** To facilitate development and testing, we have integrated the Fuji test network, allowing you to experiment without using real AVAX (Avalanche tokens).
- **Metamask Integration:** Utilize your Metamask wallet address as a secure and convenient way to log in and access the application.
- **Friend Management:** Easily add and manage friends on the platform to initiate private conversations securely.

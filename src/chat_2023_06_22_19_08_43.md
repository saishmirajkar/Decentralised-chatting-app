This line of code is used to get a signer object from the provider object. A signer is responsible for signing transactions before submitting them to the blockchain network. 

In Ethereum, a transaction must be signed with the private key of the account that wants to send the transaction. The signer object is used to provide the private key for signing the transaction. 

By using the `getSigner()` method, we can get a signer object from the provider object. The provider object is used to communicate with the Ethereum network and has access to the user's account. 

Once we have the signer object, we can use it to sign transactions with the `sendTransaction()` method or the `send()` method. These methods allow us to send transactions to the Ethereum network securely and efficiently.
